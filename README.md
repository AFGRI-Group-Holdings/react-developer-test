# React Developer Test

Welcome to the React Developer Test! This project is designed to assess your skills in React, TypeScript, and modern frontend development. Please follow the instructions below to complete the test.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command in the project root and ensure you are on node v20 >:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

## Your Task

You will find a simple birthday calendar application. Your goal is to improve and extend the application as described below:

### Requirements

1. **Code Quality**

   - Use TypeScript throughout the project and where possible.
   - Ensure your code is clean, readable, and well-structured.
   - Use functional components and React hooks.
   - Add comments where necessary.

2. **Features to Implement or Improve**

   - Add the functionality to add a birthday to the calendar.
   - Validate the form to prevent invalid or duplicate entries.
   - Showcase state management between the React components.
   - When a birthday is submitted in the BirthdayForm component it should be consumed in the BirthdayCalendar, when clicking on a date that matches a birthday that was added it should appear below the calendar.
   - Look out for _TODO_ comments along the way as tips on what to implement.

3. **UI/UX**

   - Make the UI visually appealing and user-friendly.
   - Use CSS modules or another modern styling approach.
   - Ensure the app is responsive and works well on mobile devices.

4. **Bonus**

   - Add functionality to delete a birthday from the calendar.
   - Display birthdays in a sorted order (e.g., by date or name)
   - Notification that a birthday has been added upon submission.
   - Improve the overall styling of the Birthday Calendar

## Submission

- Ensure your code is committed and pushed to your repository.
- Provide a link to your repository for review.

## Good Luck!
